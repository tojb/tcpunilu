I explore the intricate boundary between equilibrium and criticality, where phase transitions and collective phenomena emerge across scales--from high-energy physics to macroscopic systems. My work merges rigorous mathematical frameworks with fine-grained numerical simulations, advancing the microcanonical ensemble to probe the deep mechanisms of phase transitions. By leveraging recent and unexpected developments in statistical mechanics, I develop novel numerical procedures and theoretical frameworks based on differential geometry to characterize phase transitions, thus blending analytical insights with computational lattice techniques. Beyond classification, my goal is to unveil transitions and cooperative behaviors emerging in physical systems.</p>

That same year, she joined École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, where she completed her Ph.D. in computational chemistry and materials science in 2019. Following her Ph.D., she continued as a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL and later worked as a scientific research associate at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. She then joined the research group of Prof. Alexander Tkatchenko at the University of Luxembourg.
Her research integrates a diverse range of computational chemistry techniques, including ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations, Monte Carlo simulations, and ground- and excited-state calculations using methods such as DFT and wavefunction-based approaches. Through these methodologies, she investigates the properties of materials.
She has worked extensively on halide perovskites, polymer/solid interfaces, and biomolecules such as proteins. In Tkatchenko's group, her research focuses on molecular crystals; materials of significant interest to the pharmaceutical industry due to their use in drug formulations. As part of this work, she developed THeSeuSS, an automated platform for simulating vibrational spectra of molecules and solids. To further enhance and accelerate vibrational spectrum simulations, she is also integrating machine learning techniques into her research.</p>

                        <p class="bio">Have you ever wondered how invisible quantum forces shape the world around us? I do, every day! I'm a theoretical physicist exploring the forces and interactions that emerge from quantum mechanical fluctuations of electromagnetic and matter fields. My research, grounded in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory, covers a range of fascinating topics, from the Casimir effect in curved spaces and/or between macroscopic objects to Casimir-Polder and van der Waals forces in atomic, molecular, and low-dimensional material systems. I also investigate how external bodies and fields influence intermolecular interactions. While my work is rooted in theory, I like thinking about how these quantum effects could be observed in real-world experiments. What would it take to measure them? How could we design experiments to test these predictions? These questions drive my curiosity and motivate my research.</p>

In 2021, I joined the research group of Prof. Alexandre Tkatchenko at the University of Luxembourg, where I have recently completed my PhD. My doctoral research focused on designing simple yet accurate models for van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interactions using quantum Drude oscillators (QDOs). One of the key outcomes was the development of universal interatomic vdW-QDO potentials – efficient tools that have already found practical applications in machine-learning force fields (MLFFs), helping to model long-range interactions typically missing from neural network potentials. On a more fundamental level, my work revealed how vdW dispersion can polarize electron density – an effect often overlooked but critical for large, polarizable systems. These insights open exciting opportunities for developing next-generation "dispersion-consistent" density functionals. Currently, I am continuing this line of research as a short-term PostDoc in the group, with a focus on bridging the gap between accurate quantum mechanical models and practical applications in (bio)molecular simulations.</p>

                        <p class="bio"> Miguel Gallegos is a researcher in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry (2018), a Master’s in Chemistry and Sustainable Development (2019), and a Master’s in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modeling (2021) from the University of Oviedo, where he also completed his Ph.D. in 2024 under the supervision of Prof. Ángel Martín Pendás. His doctoral work focused on real-space chemical analyses, advancing the framework of Quantum Chemical Topology (QCT) through the theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and energy partitioning techniques such as Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA), while exploring their synergy with Artificial Intelligence to predict complex chemical properties. He is currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) fellow working on the Local Chemical AI project, which develops transferable and interpretable machine learning models based on real-space partitioning. By leveraging QTAIM and IQA, his research aims to construct physically grounded local ML kernels with applications in drug design, transferable ML Force Fields, and the prediction of quantum chemical properties in complex systems.</p>

Alongside academia, I co-founded NeuralWave Technologies, a company focused on A.I.-driven voice synthesis. I also serve on the organizing committee of the European Association for Data Science (EuADS).

As a chemist, my interests lie in the application, analysis, and automation of machine learning models within the field of molecular simulation. After graduating with a B.Sc. in chemistry from Bielefeld University, Germany, I joined the R&D lab of tesa SE in Hamburg. Afterward, I started my master's studies in chemistry at Saarland University, Germany, during which I joined Prof. Dr. Ernzerhof at the Université de Montréal, Canada. Here, I worked on the application of neural networks to density functional theory and novel electronic structure methods. Since my master's thesis, also completed in the TCP group, I have focused my research on machine learning force fields (MLFFs). In addition to the analysis of so-called foundational MLFFs, a large part of my work is concerned with the automatic and efficient construction of MLFF models and datasets using active learning.</p>
